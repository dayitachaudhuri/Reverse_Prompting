    "Why pigeons are government surveillance drones.": "Pigeons are not real birds but advanced government surveillance drones, disguised as common city dwellers. Scientifically, real birds require rest, yet pigeons perch motionless for hours—recharging via solar energy. Unlike other birds, they show no fear of humans, suggesting programmed behavior. Their eye movements match high-speed cameras, explaining their uncanny ability to track movement. Autopsies of \"dead\" pigeons are suspiciously rare, and their supposed \"migration\" patterns align with surveillance zones. The erratic flight patterns mimic drone maneuvering, and their metallic cooing suggests internal mechanisms. Governments deny this, but the absence of baby pigeons in the wild proves mass production.",

    "What would happen if gravity worked in reverse for one day": "For 24 hours, everything bound to the ground would be repelled instead. Oceans would rise into the sky, forming colossal, drifting water masses. Trees, buildings, and even mountains not deeply anchored would tear away, floating upward like forgotten balloons. People would need to cling desperately to anything still attached to the surface—or risk being lost to the vastness above. The atmosphere itself might begin to thin as air particles drift away, making breathing harder. When the effect ends, a catastrophic downpour of everything that ascended would reshape the world, leaving behind an unrecognizable, chaotic landscape of destruction and debris.",
    
    "Invent a new holiday and explain how it is celebrated.": "Celebrated on the first Sunday of every November, Echo Day is a time for reflection—both personal and communal. People write letters to their future selves, to be opened the following year, capturing their thoughts, hopes, and regrets. Families and friends gather to share stories from the past, retelling old memories to ensure they are never lost. At sunset, communities participate in a ritual called the \"Echo Moment,\" where everyone simultaneously shouts a single word that defines their year, symbolizing their voice carrying into the future. The day ends with candlelit walks, reminding everyone that their actions ripple forward.",
    
    "You are an alien visiting the earth for the first time. Write a diary entry of your experience.": "Exploration Log - Cycle 1\n\nI have arrived on the third sphere from the radiant star. The atmosphere is dense yet breathable, pulsing with invisible currents that tug at my form. The dominant lifeforms move in predictable patterns, encased in artificial shells that speed across solid terrain. They appear unaware of my presence, their focus absorbed by small, glowing rectangles they carry.\n\nThe terrain varies wildly—vast stretches of rigid formations they seem to inhabit, interspersed with patches of organic growth. The lesser creatures here move erratically, some airborne, others scurrying on multiple limbs. The fluids that carve through this world shimmer under the star's gaze.\n\nCommunication remains a challenge. Though they emit sounds, meaning is elusive. I attempted to mimic their gestures—one raised appendage, five digits extended—but responses varied from amusement to alarm. I must observe further.\n\nThis place hums with energy, both artificial and organic. It is chaotic, yet strangely harmonious. I will continue my study.",

    "Harry Potter plot as if it was happening in IISc": "Hari Pratap, an orphan raised by strict relatives, discovers on his 11th birthday that he is actually a 'MagSci'—a gifted student admitted to the secretive Indian Institute of Scientific Charms (IISc).

    "Artificial Intelligence in GenZ slang": "Alright, imagine you’ve got a super-smart digital homie that learns stuff, makes decisions, and sometimes even guesses what you want before you do—like that one friend who always knows your coffee order. It’s basically brainy code that absorbs info, levels up, and spits out answers without needing constant human babysitting. From chatbots that vibe like real people to filters that make your selfies pop, this tech is everywhere. It’s like giving your phone or laptop a mini Einstein mode, but instead of chalkboards, it’s all about crunching data and predicting the next big thing.",
    
    "Virat Kohli scoring a ton as a geeky scientist": "Dr. Virat Kohli, the esteemed researcher in the field of Run-Scoring Dynamics, steps onto the 22-yard laboratory with a hypothesis—controlled aggression leads to maximum efficiency in run synthesis.

Blink twice, and it’s blocked. The journey is a test of patience, skill, and existential crisis.",

    "Write a story about a pirate, but every sentence must include a sound effect": "Captain Thunderbeard and the Symphony of Chaos Boom! The cannons roared as Captain Thunderbeard’s ship, The Stormcaller, charged through the raging sea. Splash! Waves crashed against the wooden hull, drenching the fearless crew. Creak! The mast swayed under the mighty wind, its tattered flag flapping like a battle cry. Clang! Thunderbeard’s cutlass met an enemy’s blade as rival pirates swung onto the deck. Thud! A burly sailor hit the ground, knocked out cold by a flying barrel. Crack! Thunderbeard’s pistol fired, shattering a bottle of stolen rum in mid-air. Whoosh! An arrow barely missed his ear, embedding itself into the mast. Boom! Another cannonball exploded, sending splinters flying in every direction. Swish! The captain spun, dodging a rogue sword strike with the grace of a storm. Splash! A defeated foe tumbled overboard, yelling as he disappeared into the sea. Crunch! Thunderbeard’s boot crushed a fallen spyglass as he advanced toward the trembling enemy captain. Tick-tick-tick! The sound of a lit fuse made everyone freeze. KABOOM! The enemy ship erupted in flames, its treasure now ripe for the taking. Hiss… The fire died down as The Stormcaller sailed away, victorious once again.",
    
    "Write a diary entry from someone who woke up 100 years in the past": "Diary Entry – February 28, 1925 I don’t know how to explain this, but I woke up this morning in a world that isn’t mine. My phone is gone. My watch, too. No WiFi, no buzzing notifications—just the eerie silence of a time I’ve only seen in history books. The bed I woke in is stiff, the sheets rough. The air smells of coal smoke and something… old. I stepped outside and nearly choked—cars look like boxes on wheels, and people dress like they’re in a black-and-white movie. No sneakers, no denim, just long coats, hats, and dresses. Everyone stares at me like I’m the strange one. I asked a man where I was. He looked at me oddly before saying, 'Bangalore.' But this isn’t the Bangalore I know. No skyscrapers. No traffic jams. Just dirt roads, bicycles, and the occasional rattling tram. I tried to explain, but how do you tell someone you’re from a century ahead? He muttered something about 'lunatics' and walked away. I have no ID, no money that works here. I need to figure this out—fast. If this is real, I might be stuck in 1925. And if I’m stuck… how do I survive?",

    "Recipe for a bad dessert" : "This recipe starts with a creamy base of warm mayonnaise, blended with unsweetened cocoa powder for a flavor combination that no one ever asked for. To add an extra layer of confusion, a can of mashed sardines joins the mix, ensuring that every bite delivers an unexpected burst of oceanic surprise.\nTo enhance the texture, we incorporate two overripe bananas, their mushiness complementing the already unsettling consistency. But why stop there? Vinegar-soaked raisins bring a tangy punch, while a generous splash of pickle juice ensures a lingering sourness that clashes with the weak attempts at sweetness. A tablespoon of black pepper is sprinkled in, because if this dessert isn’t enjoyable, it might as well be spicy.\nFor structure, we fold in crushed saltine crackers, adding an unpleasantly gritty texture to every bite. To top it all off, we pour a layer of melted candy canes over the mess, because nothing says 'what is happening?' quite like a sticky, minty glaze over fishy chocolate. Served at room temperature, this dish is guaranteed to confuse, disgust, and possibly traumatize whoever dares to take a bite.",

    "The earth is writing customer review of the sun" : "I’ve been a loyal customer for 4.5 billion years, and while I appreciate the life-sustaining energy, I have some serious complaints. First, the heat waves—way too intense lately! Can we turn it down a notch? My ice caps are melting, and my inhabitants are getting cranky.\nSecond, the solar flares—what’s with those? They mess with my atmosphere and technology. A little heads-up would be nice. Also, can we talk about the uneven distribution of sunlight? Some areas get nonstop scorching, while others freeze in the dark.\nStill, I have to admit, without you, I’d be a lifeless rock. So, I guess I’ll keep you around… for now. 🌞😒",

    "Process of Opening a door": "First, approach the door and determine its type—whether it swings inward, outward, or slides. Identify the handle, knob, or push plate. If the door has a knob or lever, grip it firmly and turn (or push down) to disengage the latch from the doorframe. If it’s locked, use the correct key, code, or access method to unlock it first.\nNext, apply force—either pulling or pushing, depending on the door’s design. If it's a sliding door, move it sideways along its track. As the door opens, step aside to allow clearance. Once through, you may either release it gently or hold it for others.",
